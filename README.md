# ASL Recognition Model

## Overview

Welcome to the ASL Recognition Model repository! This project is dedicated to advancing the field of American Sign Language (ASL) recognition through the development of a cutting-edge deep learning model. Our model aims to accurately identify ASL hand gestures representing letters and numbers, contributing to improved accessibility and communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our model pushes the boundaries of ASL recognition accuracy and robustness.

The ASL Recognition Model boasts a sophisticated architecture designed to handle the complexities of ASL hand gesture recognition:

- **Input Layer**: Grayscale images of ASL hand gestures are fed into the input layer, serving as the foundation for subsequent processing.

- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers form the backbone of our model, extracting hierarchical features from input images with remarkable precision. These layers employ learnable filters to capture intricate patterns and spatial relationships inherent in ASL hand gestures.

- **Max-Pooling Layers**: Strategic integration of max-pooling layers facilitates spatial downsampling, preserving essential information while reducing computational complexity.

- **Fully Connected Layers**: The extracted features are then propagated through fully connected layers, enabling the model to learn complex representations and make informed predictions.

- **Output Layer**: The final layer, equipped with the softmax activation function, yields probabilistic predictions for each ASL class, facilitating seamless interpretation of hand gestures.
